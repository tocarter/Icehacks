    q: "What is a hackathon?",
    a: "A week where you build something from scratch with a small team, then show it off. There is no exam, no grade, and nothing to lose. Most people come in with no idea what they are making and leave with a thing that works.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who can come?",
    a: "Any high school student. You do not need to be from a particular school, district, or club. You do not need a team either.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I have never written code?",
    a: "Then you are exactly who we built this for. Workshops start from zero, mentors are around all week, and Best First Hack is a prize only first-timers can win.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does it cost?",
    a: "Nothing. Entry is free. You need a laptop, a charger, and decent internet.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a team or an idea?",
    a: "No to both. There is team formation after opening ceremony on Nov 8, and teams are up to four people. Plenty of people show up alone.",
